Is Apple Cloud Affected?,"Starting from February 10th, serious wildfires broke out in Guizhou Province, located in southwestern China, with more than 200 large fires engulfing nearly half of the province. Sources say that the reason why the CCP has severely suppressed reports about the fires is related to China's big data centers in Guizhou province. Meanwhile, Apple’s data center in China, Guizhou-Cloud Big Data, which is used to store Chinese customers' iCloud data, could also be affected.Today,  let's talk about this major event, which has not been covered much by other media.Truth saves lives.

2024-03-19,Producers' preferences for risk management in the apple sector in the Autonomous Province of Trento.,"The projects aims at eliciting the willingness to pay for the an innovative risk management tool (i.e. the income stabilization tool, IST) of a representative sample of apple producers in the territory of the Autonomous Province of Trento (PAT), in Italy. Moreover, subjective beliefs regarding future income variations and risk preferences are elicited in the study. To this end we develop an online experiment with a representative sample of 150 farmers in the PAT. Participants are randomly allocated into three different treatment groups: I) control, ii) individual past (IP), iii) general past (GP). The farmers in the IP and GP treatments will be subjected to the activation of the availability heuristics, while farmers in the control group will be not. To trigger the heuristic, farmers in the IP group will be asked to report, before expressing their WTP in part one of the study, to report their average income from apple in the last 10 years (2013-2023) and then to tick in which years (between 2013 and 2023) their annual income has fallen below the -20% with respect to the 10 years average. On the other hand farmers in the GP treatment will be given this information. Farmers will be informed about the average income from apple in the PAT in the period 2013-2023 and also in which years the annual income has been below -20% with respect to the average. . The aim of the project is: i) to check if triggering the heuristic has an effect on the WTP of farmers for the IST, ii) to check if there is difference in the effect between those farmers who are asked to provide information regarding their income compared to those farmers who are given the information.
The experiment builds on the oTree open source framework (https://www.otree.org/)."

2024-06-01,Rapid and Non-destructive Estimation of Apple Tree NPK Contents based on Leaf Spectral Analysis,"IntroductionApple is one of the most frequently 
consumed fruits in the world. It is a source of minerals, fiber, various
 biological compounds such as vitamin C, and phenolic compounds (natural
 antioxidants). The amount of nutrients plays a significant role in the 
growth, reproduction, and performance of agricultural products and 
plants. Chemical inputs can be accurately managed by predicting these 
elements. Thus, timely and accurate monitoring and managing the status 
of crop nutrition is crucial for adjusting fertilization, increasing the
 yield, and improving the quality. This approach minimizes the 
application of chemical fertilizers and reduces the risk of 
environmental degradation. In crop plants, leaf samples are typically 
analyzed to diagnose nutrient deficiencies and imbalances, as well as to
 evaluate the effectiveness of the current nutrient management system. 
Therefore, the main aim of this study is to estimate the level of 
Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) elements in the leaves 
of the apple tree using the non-destructive method of 
Visible/Near-infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy at the wavelength range of 
500 to 1000 nm coupled with chemometrics analysis.Materials and MethodsThis
 research investigated the potential of the Vis/NIR spectroscopy coupled
 with chemometrics analysis for predicting NPK nutrient levels of apple 
trees. In this study, 80 leaf samples of apple trees were randomly 
picked and transferred to the laboratory for spectral measurement. The 
Green-Wave spectrometer (StellarNet Inc, Florida, USA) was utilized to 
collect the spectral data. In the next step, the spectral data were 
transferred to the laptop using the Spectra Wiz software (StellarNet 
Inc, Florida, USA). For this purpose, spectroscopy of the leaf samples 
was done in interactance mode. Ten random points were selected on each 
leaf to capture reflectance spectra and the averaged spectrum was used 
to determine the reflectance (R). The data was then transformed into 
absorbance (log 1/R) for chemometrics analysis. Following the 
spectroscopy measurements, the NPK contents were measured using 
reference methods. Afterward, Partial Least Square (PLS) multivariate 
calibration models were developed based on the reference measurements 
and spectral information using different pre-processing techniques. To 
remove the unwanted effects, various pre-processing methods were 
utilized to obtain an accurate calibration model. To evaluate the 
proposed models, the Root Mean Square Error of calibration and 
prediction sets (RMSEC and RMSEP), as well as the correlation 
coefficient of calibration and prediction sets (rc and rp), and Residual Predictive Deviation (RPD) were calculated.Results and DiscussionThe
 statistical metrics were calculated for the evaluation of PLS models 
and the results indicated that the PLS models could efficiently predict 
the NPK contents with satisfactory accuracy. The model with the best 
performance for nitrogen prediction was based on the standard normal 
variate pre-processing method in combination with the second derivative 
(SNV+D2) and resulted in rc= 0.988, RMSEC=0.028%, rp=0.978, RMSEP=0.034%, and RPD of 7.47. The best model for P content prediction resulted in rc= 0.967, RMSEC=0.0051%, rp=0.958, RMSEP=0.0057%, and RPD of 5.96. Additionally, the PLS model based on MSC+D2 pre-processing method resulted in rc= 0.984, RMSEC=0.017%, rp=0.976,
 RMSEP=0.021%, and RPD of 7.10, indicating the high potential of PLSR 
model in predicting K content. Moreover, the weakest performing model 
was related to the estimation of P content without pre-processing with rc = 0.774, RMSEC = 0.013%, rp
 = 0.685, RMSEP = 0.018%, and RPD value of 1.87. Based on the obtained 
results, the proposed PLS models coupled with suitable pre-processing 
methods were able to predict the nutrient content with high precision.ConclusionField
 spectroscopy has recently gained popularity due to its portability, 
ease of use, and low cost. Consequently, the use of a portable system 
for estimating nutrient levels in the field can significantly save time 
and lower laboratory expenses. Therefore, due to the accuracy of the 
Vis/NIR spectroscopy technique and according to the obtained results, 
this method can be used to actualize a portable system based on Vis/NIR 
spectroscopy to estimate the nutrient elements needed by the apple trees
 in the orchards and to increase the productivity of the orchards."

Lyrics: Ever on and on
I continue circling
With nothing but my hate
In a carousel of agony
'Til slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
And suddenly I see that I can't
Break free, I'm
Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity
With nothing but my pain and a paralyzing agony
To tell me who I am! Who I was!
Uncertainty enveloping my mind
'Til I can't break free, and
Maybe it's a dream, maybe nothing else is real
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
So I'm tired of all the pain, all the misery inside
And I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the night
You could tell me what to say, you could tell me where to go
But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know
If I make another move, there'll be no more turning back
Because everything would change, and it all would fade to black
Will tomorrow ever come? Will I make it through the night?
Will there ever be a place for the broken in the light?
Am I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay or should I go?
I've forgotten how to tell, did I ever even know?
Can I take another step? I've done everything I can
All the people that I see, they will never understand
If I find a way to change, if I step into the light
Then I'll never be the same and it all will fade to white
Ever on and on
I continue circling
With nothing but my hate
In a carousel of agony
'Til slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
And suddenly I see that I can't
Break free, I'm
Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity
With nothing but my pain and a paralyzing agony
To tell me who I am! Who I was!
Uncertainty enveloping my mind
'Til I can't break free, and
Maybe it's a dream, maybe nothing else is real
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
So I'm tired of all the pain, all the misery inside
And I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the night
You could tell me what to say, you could tell me where to go
But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know
If I make another move, there'll be no more turning back
Because everything would change, and it all would fade to black
If I make another move, if I take another step
Then it would all fall apart, there'd be nothing of me left
If I'm crying in the wind, if I'm crying in the night
Will there ever be a way? Will my heart return to white?
Can you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I am?
I've forgotten how to see, I've forgotten if I can
If I open up my eyes, there'll be no more going back
'Cause I'll throw it all away, and it all will fade to black

2024-06-24,Investigation on the Efficacy of Trifloxystrobin+Fluopyram (Luna Sensation® 500SC) Fungicide in Apple Scab Control Caused by Venturia inaequalis,"

Introduction[]

Scab disease of
apple caused by Venturia inaequalis is one of the most important
diseases of apple in the world and Iran. Especially in areas with wet and cold
weather its damage reach more than 70%. Apple scab results in symptoms on most
upper plant parts, notably leaves and fruit.  Petioles, flowers,
sepals, pedicels, young shoots, and bud scales can also become infected. Apple
scab infections are initiated in early spring on emerging and young leaves. The
Mills table relates leaf wetness duration and temperature to determine the
likelihood that conidial infection will occur. For example, at an average
temperature of 18°C (65°F), light infection will result if leaves remain wet
for 9 h. Lesions can produce conidia after 9 days if the temperature averages
18°C (65°F), but not until 17 days if the temperatures are lower, averaging
only 8°C (49°F). 

 

Materials and Methods

The experiment was conducted in apple orchards located in
Yasuj, Bojnourd and Karaj which had a history of apple scab. The experimental
design was a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 8 treatments and 4
replications. The control treatments included plots without any spraying and
plots sprayed with water. The remaining treatments involved the application of
specific treatments at three different stages. The first spraying was done at
swelling of leaf buds time, the second spraying after fall leaves, and the
third spraying 14 days after the second spray. 30 days after observing the
first symptoms of the disease in the controls, samples were taken from the
leaves and fruits to evaluate the percentage of the disease density and
severity of the disease. The data obtained for disease incidence and severity
were analyzed using statistical software, such as SAS, and the means of these
traits were compared using Duncan's multiple range test at a significance level
of one percent. This test helps determine significant differences between the
treatment means.

 

Results and Discution 

The analysis of variance conducted
on the data obtained from the evaluation of treated trees revealed a
statistically significant effect of the treatments on reducing the percentage
of disease severity and disease incidence. Result showed that, there are
significant differences between treatments and controls in all three provinces
(P = 5%). Mean comparisons of the treatments showed that, all fungicides
caused a significant decrease in the severity and incidence of disease
infection percent compared to controls. The results of three provinces showed
that new fungicide Luna Sensation 500® SC 0.4 and 0.6 ml L-1 and
Flint® 50% WG 0.2 ml L-1 during three times spraying is
very effective on controlling of apple scab. In Kohghiloyeh and Boyerahmad, 0.4
and 0.6 ml L-1 of Luna Sensation had the best efficiency compared to
other treatments. The severity of disease was lower than control about 96
percent in leaves and 98 percent in fruits. Also, incidence of disease in fruit
and leaf of these treatments were lower than the other treatments. In North
Khorasan province Flint 0.2 ml L-1 and Luna Sensation 0.4 compared
to other treatments was more effective in controlling the disease severity and
approximately 75 percent compared to controls reduced disease severity on
fruits. Also on leaves Luna Sensation 0.4 were effective approximately 80
percent. In terms of disease control on fruit, there were no significant
differences between all fungicide treatments except benomyl. Disease incidence
on the leaves treated with all three concentrations of Luna Sensation and 0.2
ml L-1 Flint was lower than other treatments. In Alborze province,
Luna Sensation 0.4 and 0.6 ml L-1 and Flint 0.2 ml L-1 had
the best efficacy and nearly 100 percent decrease severity and incidence of
disease in leaves in compared with controls. The results of three provinces showed
that new fungicide Luna Sensation 500® SC 0.4 and 0.6 ml L-1 and
Flint® 50% WG 0.2 ml L-1 during three times spraying is very
effective on controlling of apple scab. Also, the results showed that Luna
Sensation fungicide can control apple scab disease on Golden Delicious and Red
Delicious and The type of cultivar has no effect on the efficacy of the
fungicide. Results show that Luna Sensation 500® SC
0.4 is an effective fungicide to control apple scab and can be used in apple
orchards as a part of integrated pest management program. The management of
apple scab disease in the world usually requires multiple sprayings, from the
greening stage of the branches to harvest. Since V. inaequalis has a
high risk of developing resistance to fungicides, the alternating use of
effective fungicides from different groups and with different mechanisms of
action or the use of fungicides with multiple mechanisms of action in disease
management programs are necessary to prevent resistance. The new fungicide
Lunasenish® SC 500, which is composed of 21.4% trifloxystrobin, 21.4% flupiram
and 57.2% related substances, is a systemic fungicide with a wide range of
effects.

Introduction 

Apple
(Malus domestica) is considered as one of the important members of the
Rosaceae family and is among the most consumed fruits in the world. One of the
biggest challenges for agricultural researchers is to increase the quantity and
quality of food to feed the growing population, without negatively affecting
the health of the soil and agricultural ecosystems. Due to the adverse effects
of chemicals on human health and environmental safety, the production of
organic products has been considered as one of the most important issues in
food production systems. It is utilized in various forms, including fresh fruit
or processed as industrial products. Based on the respiratory and ethylene
production pattern, apples are classified as climacteric fruits. Metabolic
activities and ripening continue after harvest, so apples have the potential to
transform into highly perishable products after harvest. Post-harvest
treatments are certainly not the most suitable method for preserving the shelf
life and quality of fruits during the post-harvest period. Therefore, employing
new and effective methods to enhance quality, control decay, and consequently
extend the post-harvest life of apples appears to be essential. Organic
farming, as an agricultural system to protect human health and the environment,
can improve product quality and shelf life.

 

Materials and Methods

This
study was conducted on an apple orchard (Malus domestica) in Zarabad area of Khoy
city located in the northwest of Iran (with the same management and growth
conditions) in 2018-2019. The experiment was conducted as a factorial in the
form of a completely randomized block design in 4 replications. The
experimental factors included spraying fruit trees with nano-chitosan in 3
concentrations (zero, 5 and 10 ml) and ferulic acid in 3 concentrations (zero,
0.5 and 1 mM). Apple trees in three times, the first stage in the hazelnut
time. Fruit drop, the second stage 20 days after the first stage and the third
stage 20 days after the second stage spraying, were sprayed in the afternoon
using a Cross mark PB20 manual sprayer. The harvested fruits were sprayed
according to the treatments were packed and labeled and transferred to the
central laboratory of horticultural sciences of Urmia University.
After 24 hours of storage at the laboratory temperature, the measurement of the
studied traits started on the fruits, the control treatment in this experiment
was distilled water with Tween 80 (0.1/v/v).

 

Results and Discussion

Compared
to the control group, fruits treated with a
combination of chitosan and ferulic acid exhibited a significant increase in
firmness after harvest. Notably, the most effective treatment involved a
combination of 10 milliliters of nano-chitosan and 1 millimolar ferulic acid,
resulting in the highest level of firmness among all treatments.As a result,
the combined treatment of chitosan and ferulic acid can delay the aging process
by reducing the activity of enzymes involved in cell wall degradation and
maintain firmness in apples, contributing to a positive effect. According to
the obtained results, fruits treated with nano-chitosan and ferulic acid showed
a higher soluble solid content compared to the control fruits, and this amount
increased with the higher concentrations of nano-chitosan and ferulic acid. The minimum
level of TA was observed in the control treatment, and the highest level was
observed in the treatment with 10 milliliters of chitosan and 1 millimolar
ferulic acid. The treatment with 1 millimolar ferulic acid and 10 milliliters
of chitosan showed the highest percentage of TA content compared to the
control. The combination of nano-chitosan and ferulic acid treatment led to a
reduction in fruit juice pH, with the lowest pH observed in the treatment with
1 millimolar ferulic acid and 10 milliliters of chitosan, and the highest pH
observed in the control treatment. Vitamin C is the primary water-soluble
antioxidant that directly reduces damage caused by free radicals. According to
the obtained results, the maximum content of vitamin C was observed in the
treatment with 1 millimolar ferulic acid and 10 milliliters of chitosan.
According to the obtained results, the maximum PAL enzyme activity was observed
in the treatment with 1 millimolar ferulic acid and 10 milliliters of chitosan.

 

Conclusion 

In general, the
findings of the current study showed that
pre-harvest treatment with nano-chitosan and ferulic
acid had a positive effect on the post-harvest quality of apple fruits. The
fruits treated with the highest concentration of nano-chitosan and ferulic
acid exhibited the highest fruit firmness, titratable acidity, vitamin C
content, PAL enzyme activity, and the lowest pH compared to the control fruits.
These results indicate that nano-chitosan and ferulic
acid treatment can be proposed as a promising and healthy method for improving
the post-harvest quality of apple fruits.

2024-09-23,Investigating the Qualitative Changes of Golden Delicious Apple Variety during Storage Using X-ray Imaging,"

Introduction

Isfahan
province is considered to be one of the top ten producing provinces of apple
orchards with an area of 17,274 hectares and a production of 120,000 tons of
apple. Determining the quality parameters of
agricultural products requires the use of various methods, which are different
according to the nature and characteristics of each product. The two main categories for dividing these methods
include analytical (objective) methods and sensory (intrinsic) methods. Both qualitative assessment methods can be used in
destructive and non-destructive ways. Apple is one of the fruits that can be stored for a
relatively long time. Physiological changes during the storage period are
inevitable and cause  change to some
quality characteristics of the fruit, such as firmness, moisture content,
density, pH, and soluble solids. Using the methods of determining and extracting the
quality characteristics of fruit during storage and monitoring the changes
created, provides a suitable criterion for selecting and preparing the
necessary conditions for storage and storage at the disposal of users and
producers. X-ray imaging technique is among the methods
used and computed tomography, which is now well-known in evaluation of various
agricultural commodities and food quality. X-rays are electromagnetic waves with a short wavelength
(0.01 to 10 nm) and high energy (from 120 electron volts to 120 kilo electron
volts) that can penetrate many materials.

 

Materials and Methods

In order to determine the relationship between
the physicochemical properties and the CT number of Golden Delicious apples,
280 Golden Delicious apples were collected from an orchard located in Semirom
city of Isfahan province and stored in a cold room at 0 and 4 ºC and a humidity
of 85±5%. These apples were harvested and collected from several
trees after the fruit ripened completely. The weight and volume of apples were randomly
selected based on the apples on the trees. The samples of stored apples were examined in
4 stages and based on the duration of storage on zero (the beginning of
storage), 45, 90 and 135 days.. These tests included non-destructive tests of
CT scan imaging and destructive tests to extract the physicochemical properties
of apples, including CT number, pH, firmness, moisture, density, and soluble
solids. In order to prepare CT scan images of apple samples (non-destructive
X-ray test), a GE Healthcare multi-slice CT scan machine model 5122080-12 with
80 kV and 10 mA was used in the CT scan center of Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan.
Moisture content was determined by weighing the samples and recording their
moisture changes before and after drying in the oven at 105 ºC s for 24 hours.
Total soluble solids were measured by refractometer device and reported as Brix
degree. In order to measure the density of fruits, the weight and volume of
each fruit was recorded. A digital pH meter was used to measure the pH of fruit.
Penetrometer device was used to measure the firmness of apples. At the end,
with the specified values, Pearson correlation coefficients between CT number
and other physicochemical properties were determined. Also, by plotting the
mentioned values, the most suitable regression equations with the highest
coefficients of determination were obtained.

 

Results and Discussion

Based on the
results, the average value of CT number, pH, firmness, moisture, density and
total soluble solid of apple at two temperatures of zero and 4 ºC were -115.02
and -166.86, 3.85 and 3.86, 76 37.36 and 33.36 N, 0.82 and 0.80%, 0.76 and 0.72
g/cm3  and 15.30 and 15.79%
Brix, respectively. The results showed that the CT number has a negative
linear correlation with pH and total soluble solid and a positive linear
correlation with the properties of apple firmness, moisture and fruit density. Based on the results, at two storage temperatures of 0
and 4 ºC, the coefficients of determination (R2) obtained from the
linear regression model of CT number with pH levels of 0.75 and 0.55, apple
firmness 0.32 and 0.57, moisture content 0.78 and 0.85, fruit density 0.82 and
0.84 and total soluble solid 0.85 and 0.62 were obtained.

 

Conclusion

These results shown that the non-destructive test of
X-ray imaging can be used with a suitable approximation to determine some
quality properties of apple products.

A total of 38 participants were administered the PPAT assessment, 20 first born and 18 last born subjects. The rating manual Formal Elements of Art Therapy (FEATS) was used with a list of global image indicators of problem solving in a participant's art. Attributes inherently present in sibling positioning were applied as evidenced from previous theoretical literature and research. The rating scales included identifying indicators and elements found in the drawings of first born or last-born individuals. Two Art Therapy trained professionals rated the PPAT drawings. Indicators and characteristics of birth order found in the assessments were used to determine if a participant is first born or last born. Results demonstrated a positive relationship between PPAT birth order indicators, PSI scores and a participant's true birth order."

2024-11-28,Optimized deep learning-based dual segmentation framework for diagnosing health of apple farming with the internet of things,"The high disease prevalence in apple farms results in decreased yield and income. This research addresses these issues by integrating internet of things (IoT) applications and deep neural networks to automate disease detection. Existing methods often suffer from high false positives and lack global image similarity. This study proposes a conceptual framework using IoT visual sensors to mitigate apple diseases' severity and presents an intelligent disease detection system. The system employs the augmented Otsu technique for region-aware segmentation and a colour-conversion algorithm for generating feature maps. These maps are input into U-net models, optimized using a genetic algorithm, which results in the generation of suitable masks for all input leaf images. The obtained masks are then used as feature maps to train the convolution neural network (CNN) model for detecting and classifying leaf diseases. Experimental outcomes and comparative assessments demonstrate the proposed scheme's practical utility, yielding high accuracy and low false-positive results in multiclass disease detection tasks."

2024-12-03,Review of image processing and artificial intelligence methodologies for apple leaf disease diagnosis,"Apple leaf disease (ALD) potentially affects the apple tree's health by reducing fruit yield and its capability to grow healthy. The prime purpose of the proposed study is to review and assess the strengths and weaknesses associated with the frequently exercised methods of ALD diagnosis using image processing and artificial intelligence (AI). Although these are widely adopted in recent studies, the core notion is to find the pros and cons associated with the practical viability. A desk research methodology is undertaken to carry out proposed review work where a database of recent scientific manuscripts is collected and studied very closely. The existing approaches are reviewed concerning identified problems, adopted solutions, advantages, and limitations. Finally, the paper contributes towards offering insight into potential research gap which will guide the upcoming researchers to make wise decisions for planning their models. The results acquired from this review work show that generalized challenges of ALD are not addressed, less emphasis on illumination variability, reduced target to minimize complexity, lesser evidence towards real-time processing, no evidence towards interpretability, limitation of available dataset, and tradeoff-between image processing and AI."
2024-12-04,FEX Apple Bottom Jeans ( Prototype Version),"This probably would've been funnier 2 years ago (before the song was solved lol)Also if you're wondering why this meme still uses the old instrumental, that's because I came up with the concept of this joke back when making covers of songs but with Apple Bottom Jeans lyrics was popular and before the song was ever solved, so I kinda wanted to stay faithful to my original idea lol.FEX image remaster by u/BlackHust(Also if you're wondering why I uploaded this here instead of on the me singing songs category is because I was too impatient to wait for it to upload because it was taking forever to finish the upload despite being 1.9 MB)"
2024-12-04,Apple fruits categorizing based on deep convolutional neural network techniques,"For a variety of reasons, including the high degree of similarity between varieties of the same type of fruit, the requirement to train the technique on a large amount of data, and the type and number of features suitable for application, the use of computer vision techniques in the classification of fruits still faces many challenges. Additionally, the technique's effectiveness and speed both need to be improved. Deep conventional neural network (DCNN) approaches were required for all of these reasons. A proposed include convolutional neural network (CNN) model is described in this work. The suggested methodology is intended to quickly and accurately categorize thirteen groups of apple fruits. The proposed technique was based on training and testing the model on a maximum number of images of apple fruits, by increasing the number of database images tenfold, after augmentation was performed on the images. The technology also relied on good tuning of the hyperparameters. To further ensure the efficiency of training, validation was performed on 20% of the database. All results that demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed model were reviewed. The results of the proposal were compared with the results of four related techniques. The results showed the great advantage of the proposed technology at all levels."

2025-02-18,Improved inception-V3 model for apple leaf disease classification,"Apple, a nutrient-rich fruit belonging to the genus Malus, is recognized for its fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, giving health benefits such as improved digestion and reduced cardiovascular disease risk. In Indonesia, the soil and climate create favorable conditions for apple cultivation. However, it is essential to prioritize the health of the plant. Biotic factors, such as fungal infections like apple scabs and pests, alongside abiotic factors like temperature and soil moisture, impact the health of apple plants. Computer vision, specifically convolution neural network (CNN) inception-V3, proves effective in aiding farmers in identifying these diseases. The output layer in inception-V3 is essential, generating predictions based on input data. For this reason, in this paper, we add an output layer in inception-V3 architecture to increase the accuracy of apple leaf disease classification. The added output layers are dense, dropout, and batch normalization. Adding a dense layer after flattening typically consolidates the extracted features into a more compact representation. Dropout can help prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating some units during training. Batch normalization helps normalize activations across batches, speeding up training and providing stability to the model. Test results show that the proposed method produced an accuracy of 99.27% and can increase accuracy by 1.85% compared to inception-V3. These enhancements showcase the potential of leveraging computer vision for precise disease diagnosis in apple crops."
