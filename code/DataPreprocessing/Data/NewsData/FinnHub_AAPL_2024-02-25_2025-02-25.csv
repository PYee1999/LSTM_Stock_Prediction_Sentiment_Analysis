2025-02-25,Why Trump could 'move fast' on Apple's $500B US investment plan,"Apple (AAPL) and its CEO, Tim Cook, announced plans to invest $500 billion in US operations over the next four years, which President Trump could leverage in his dealings with other chief executives. Christoff & Co. CEO Niki Christoff joins Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss how Apple's latest developments could factor into the Trump administration's strategy. ""Tim Cook and Apple are at the very front edge of this, of making commitments and giving good headlines, and the president wants to move fast on the things that he has promised. And that is America first, including having American companies make things here,"" Christoff says. The alignment between business success and the administration's goals creates a dynamic where companies are more inclined to cooperate. However, Christoff notes that not all CEO's share the same ideological views. ""I'd say people have described Tim Cook as 10% political and 90% business person, and I think that's right,"" she says. Regarding potential government interference within tech, Christoff asserts, “President Trump sees himself as a business person and he loves business success. So, no, I don’t think he’s actually going to kneecap American tech companies.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

2025-02-24,Top Apple exec concedes he had doubts about app store fees imposed on alternative payment options,"Longtime Apple executive Phil Schiller on Monday conceded he initially opposed fees that the iPhone maker charges for in app-transactions processed outside its own payment system because he feared violating a court-ordered mandate designed to create more competition.  Schiller, who oversees Apple's lucrative App Store for iPhones, made the admission during three hours of testimony in the same Oakland federal courtroom where he last appeared on the witness stand nearly nine months ago as part of a long-running legal battle with Epic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game.  Epic began the showdown four and half years ago when it first filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging that Apple had built an illegal monopoly around its popular App Store that makes billions of dollars annually from a then-exclusive payment system that collects commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app commerce."

The iPhone developer is reportedly partnering with Alibaba (BABA) to further expands its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, according to a report by The Information. TECHnalysis Research president Bob O'Donnell discusses on Asking for a Trend how the iPhone SE, with its smaller form factor and lower price, appeals to customers who prefer compact devices. ""The [iPhone] SE has never been a huge part of the iPhone market in terms of a percentage, but there is a very distinct group of people who just don't really like huge phones. And, the SE has served that market,"" O'Donnell says. While the SE may not drive massive sales, it serves a niche market, particularly in emerging regions where its affordability is key. O'Donnell comments on Apple's new AI partnership with Alibaba as the tech giant seeks to further penetrate China's consumer tech market: ""This is something that we knew had to be coming, not necessarily with Alibaba. But in order for Apple to bring Apple intelligence to China they were going to have to find a Chinese partner, and it's well known that Chinese consumers are very interested in AI capabilities.""
