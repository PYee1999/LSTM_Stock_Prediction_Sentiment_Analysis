2025-02-25,Why Trump could 'move fast' on Apple's $500B US investment plan,"Apple (AAPL) and its CEO, Tim Cook, announced plans to invest $500 billion in US operations over the next four years, which President Trump could leverage in his dealings with other chief executives. Christoff & Co. CEO Niki Christoff joins Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss how Apple's latest developments could factor into the Trump administration's strategy. ""Tim Cook and Apple are at the very front edge of this, of making commitments and giving good headlines, and the president wants to move fast on the things that he has promised. And that is America first, including having American companies make things here,"" Christoff says. The alignment between business success and the administration's goals creates a dynamic where companies are more inclined to cooperate. However, Christoff notes that not all CEO's share the same ideological views. ""I'd say people have described Tim Cook as 10% political and 90% business person, and I think that's right,"" she says. Regarding potential government interference within tech, Christoff asserts, “President Trump sees himself as a business person and he loves business success. So, no, I don’t think he’s actually going to kneecap American tech companies.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.
